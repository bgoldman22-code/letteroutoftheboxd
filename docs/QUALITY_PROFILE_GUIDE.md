# Quality Profile - Quick Reference Guide

## Overview
**Quality Profile** evaluates what KIND of cinematic craft the viewer finds meaningful, satisfying, impressive, or worthwhile. This is NOT about "good vs bad" — it's about what type of cinematic intention resonates with each viewer.

## The 8 Dimensions

### 1. Craft Precision vs Raw Expressiveness
**Scale**: 1 (raw) → 7 (precision)

| Score | Description | Example Films |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Loose framing, handheld urgency, minimal production design, emotional immediacy over technical perfection | Kids, Tangerine, Wendy and Lucy, Dogtooth |
| 3-4 | Balanced approach | |
| 5-7 | Every frame composed, lighting sculpted, performance calibrated, meticulous formal mastery | There Will Be Blood, Zodiac, Barry Lyndon, Blade Runner 2049 |

**Why it matters**: Some viewers feel craft gets in the way of truth. Others find meaning IN the craft itself.

---

### 2. Art-Cinema Mode vs Pop-Cinema Mode
**Scale**: 1 (art-cinema) → 7 (pop-cinema)

| Mode | Characteristics | Example Films |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Art-Cinema (1-2) | Ambiguity, slowness, minimalism, existential inquiry, elliptical storytelling | Drive My Car, Columbus, Jeanne Dielman, The Tree of Life |
| Pop-Cinema (6-7) | Clarity, pace, plot escalation, entertainment value, propulsive momentum | John Wick, Mad Max: Fury Road, Fast & Furious, Top Gun: Maverick |

**Why it matters**: Neither is "better"—they're different value systems. Art mode rewards patience. Pop mode rewards kinetic pleasure.

---

### 3. Narrative Ambition Level
**Scale**: 1 (sensory thrill) → 4 (grounded realism) → 7 (mythic statement)

| Level | Description | Example Films |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Pure sensory cinema—movement, spectacle, visceral pleasure over meaning | Furious 7, Top Gun: Maverick, The Raid |
| 3-5 | Human-scale realism—everyday emotional truth without cosmic metaphors | Blue Valentine, Still Walking, Manchester by the Sea |
| 6-7 | Mythic ambition—existence, mortality, humanity as philosophical concept | The Tree of Life, The Fountain, There Will Be Blood, 2001 |

**Why it matters**: Maps prestige vs entertainment without judgment. Some want Big Questions. Others want pure experience.

---

### 4. Irony / Sincerity Register
**Scale**: 1 (sincere earnest) → 7 (ironic self-aware)

| Register | Description | Example Films |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Unguarded emotion, no winking at camera, takes feelings seriously | Call Me By Your Name, Aftersun, Past Lives, Moonlight |
| 6-7 | Meta-awareness, genre play, emotional beats undercut with humor | The Nice Guys, The Menu, Everything Everywhere All At Once |

**Why it matters**: Prevents catastrophic mismatches. Don't recommend Tár to Guardians fans. Irony isn't "smart"—it's a tonal preference.

---

### 5. Emotional Weight Tolerance
**Scale**: 1 (light comfort) → 4 (mid-range) → 7 (devastating weight)

| Weight | Description | Example Films |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Buoyant, warm, restorative, emotionally safe—cinema as refuge | Paddington 2, Ratatouille, Amélie, Chef |
| 3-5 | Emotional complexity but ultimately hopeful or bittersweet | Lady Bird, Her, Brooklyn, Little Women |
| 6-7 | Devastating, unrelenting, existentially heavy, emotionally punishing | Requiem for a Dream, Come and See, Breaking the Waves, Grave of the Fireflies |

**Why it matters**: This alone prevents recommending Grave of the Fireflies to cozy-seekers. Some seek devastation. Others need safety.

---

### 6. Performance Style Preference
**Scale**: 1 (naturalistic behavioral) → 7 (heightened theatrical)

| Style | Description | Example Films |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Non-actors or naturalistic performances, behavioral minutiae, acting disappears | Kelly Reichardt films, Dardenne brothers, mumblecore |
| 6-7 | Daniel Day-Lewis mode—big, controlled, visibly "acting," theatrical presence | There Will Be Blood, The Master, Phantom Thread |

**Why it matters**: Some want to forget they're watching actors. Others love watching the craft of performance.

---

### 7. Script Construction Visibility
**Scale**: 1 (invisible organic) → 7 (visible architecture)

| Visibility | Description | Example Films |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | No three-act structure, life just unfolds, slice-of-life, narrative feels discovered | Nomadland, Paterson, Wendy and Lucy |
| 6-7 | Visible craft, intricate structure, puzzle-box satisfaction, satisfying mechanics | Knives Out, Inception, The Social Network |

**Why it matters**: Some love Nolan/Sorkin precision. Others want cinema to feel like life happening.

---

### 8. Auteur Intentionality Desire
**Scale**: 1 (collaborative process) → 7 (singular vision)

| Desire | Description | Example Films |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Improvisational, ensemble-driven, actor-focused, collaborative messiness | Mike Leigh, Cassavetes, Robert Altman |
| 6-7 | Total control, every frame stamped with directorial vision, singular artistic intelligence | Kubrick, Wes Anderson, Nolan, Villeneuve |

**Why it matters**: Some love feeling a singular intelligence at work. Others want human messiness and collaboration.

## Viewer Resonance Examples

### High-Craft Sincere Viewer
**Profile**: craft_precision=7, irony=1, weight_tolerance=5, ambition=6

> "You value high-craft emotional cinema where performance subtlety and formal control create cumulative resonance. You prefer films that explore internal struggle, presented with naturalistic cinematography, gentle pacing, and humanistic moral framing. You do not respond strongly to ironic detachment, spectacle-driven stakes, or films where emotional beats are delivered loudly rather than discovered gradually."

**Recommend**: Barry Lyndon, Phantom Thread, The Master, Burning

**Avoid**: Guardians of the Galaxy, The Menu, Deadpool

---

### Pop-Cinema Comfort-Seeker
**Profile**: craft_precision=6, art_pop=6, weight_tolerance=2, irony=3, ambition=2

> "You prefer pop-cinema mode with clarity, momentum, and satisfying escalation. You use cinema for restoration and emotional safety. You value polished visual beauty but don't need thematic density—sensory pleasure and warm storytelling are sufficient."

**Recommend**: Paddington 2, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, The Grand Budapest Hotel

**Avoid**: Requiem for a Dream, The Master, Come and See

---

### Art-Cinema Intensity-Seeker
**Profile**: art_pop=1, weight_tolerance=7, ambition=7, mystery_comfort=7

> "You prefer art-cinema mode with ambiguity, slowness, and existential inquiry. You seek devastating emotional weight and mythic philosophical statements. You're comfortable with radical inexplicability and unrelenting suffering. Light films feel trivial."

**Recommend**: The Tree of Life, Come and See, First Reformed, Under the Skin

**Avoid**: Marvel films, rom-coms, feel-good endings

---

### Self-Aware Genre Fan
**Profile**: irony=7, art_pop=6, script_visibility=7, ambition=3

> "You prefer self-aware, meta-textual cinema with visible narrative architecture. You love genre play, ironic distance, and satisfying puzzle-box structure. You want entertainment that acknowledges its own construction."

**Recommend**: Knives Out, Everything Everywhere All At Once, The Nice Guys, Cabin in the Woods

**Avoid**: Sincere emotional dramas, slow-cinema, naturalistic slice-of-life

---

## Scoring Guide for AI

When analyzing a film on Quality Profile dimensions:

1. **Gather Evidence**: Look at cinematography, editing, script structure, performance style
2. **Avoid Value Judgment**: Don't say "well-crafted" = good. Ask: what KIND of craft?
3. **Consider Intention**: Is rawness intentional (Tangerine) or lack of resources?
4. **Scale Appropriately**: Use full 1-7 range. Most films aren't dead center.
5. **Cross-Reference**: Quality Profile should align with Visual/Sound/Narrative scores

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't conflate with quality**: High craft_precision ≠ better film
❌ **Don't assume budget = precision**: Tangerine is intentionally raw, not poorly made
❌ **Don't judge viewer preferences**: Comfort-seeking is as valid as intensity-seeking
❌ **Don't ignore genre context**: Fast & Furious achieves its pop-cinema goals perfectly

✅ **Do recognize**: Different value systems for what makes cinema powerful
✅ **Do respect**: All positions on spectrum are sophisticated choices
✅ **Do prevent**: Mismatches between viewer needs and film intentions

---

**Purpose**: Enable recommendations that respect WHY viewers connect with cinema, not just WHAT they've liked.
